## Misc notes, outline, etc for  MicroPYthon / CircuitPython presentation at 3/28/2023 H.O.T meeting

#### This repo is **NOT** well organized.

* To anyone who may have wandered here, I apologize for that. 
* This started as a folder where I could toss all my half-baked ideas as I simultaneously:
    1. **Learned** about CircuitPython and MicroPython
    2. **Prepared** a talk to share my new knowledge with the folks in our Hands On Technology Club
* There are many different projects, contained in separate folders: [circuitpy_scripts](circuitpy_scripts) and [micropython_scripts](micropython_scripts)
    * The earliest projects have code that is predictably crude and simple
    * The code in later projects became more robust addressing issues like
        * WiFi reconnection after power-failure with OTA upddates
        * The code in [reconnect_on_pf](micropython_scripts/reconnect_on_pf/) can be used as a template
* [Notes0](notes0.md) hints at how I first became aware of CircuitPython and shows the path that led to eventually discovering MicroPython.
* [Notes](notes.md) is a series of breadcrumbs I left for myself as I tried to create an [outline](outline.md) for the talk
